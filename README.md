## 👋 About me
I started programming with Visual Basic .NET when I was eleven years old because I wanted to write my own Pokemon game. Upon that I tried out developing many small applications for managing data - like for sharing information about homework and tests at school or for viewing your contacts - while stopping by other programming languages like C# and C++. Later on I engaged with the world of web development learning HTML, CSS, PHP and eventually Javascript/Typescript, which I've stayed with to the present. I'm interested in knowledge management, data integration and collaborative software 😊

## 🚀 Projects
### 🐣 Websites
I'm currently developing the websites for a small indie label from Eberswalde, Germany ([Woodpecker Dreams 🡭](https://woodpecker-dreams.de)) and for a small, private festival: [Marschmosh 🡭](https://www.marschmosh.de/).

### 🌱 Floralink
For my bachelor thesis in Landscape Use and Nature Conservation, I tried to build a showcase for using existing data of plant occurences and plant taxon information to analyze ecological factors. In the relatively small world of flora and vegetation experts and enthusiasts there exist only a few old or complicated tools for working with plant occurrence and vegetation plot data. In order to show what can be done with today's databases I developed a prototype web app called [Floralink](https://github.com/floralink). Here you can analyze plant occurrence data fetched from an existing database in combination with taxon specific properties like Ellenberg indicator values (describing ecological site factors). It's supposed to act as a showcase and is not finished by any means. Feel free to try out the [online demo 🡭](https://flora-link.de).

### 🗨️ deliberat.io
Still waiting for enough time to be found to start coding, a big project is in the concept phase. [deliberat.io](https://github.com/deliberat-io) aims to be a platform for sharing arguments, connecting them with each other and analyzing their functions, types and structure. Goals are to train argumentative skills and knowledge on the one hand while deepening the understanding for different opinions and life realities of other people on the other hand.
